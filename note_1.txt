Understanding Git Basics
====================================================
**Basics**

learnt about how to ignore files with .gitignore

which stores parttern of files to ignore

it's works using regular expressions .

learnt about git diff and git diff --staged/git diff --cached

|git diff| shows changes that are yet to be staged

|git diff --staged| shows staged changes that will be included in the next commit 

the -a option is used with commit command to skip the staging area.

**How do we Remove files**

we use the |git rm| command it reomves the file from the working directory so you 
don't  see it as untracked file , to do this 

we delete/remove file  from the working directory

we call |git rm| to stage the changes 

we commit changes

**How do we move/rename files ?**

we used the git mv command

it work like this

git mv file_from file _to

====================================================
Viewing the Commit History
====================================================

the |git log| is most basic and powerful tool used for this purpose

the -patch or -p option is used to show the difference introduce in each commit
and a number option can also be  included to limit the number of entry such as -2

the --stat option is used to print a commit list entry with their respective 
modified file showing lines added , lines removed 

the are some other option used in getting printing a controlled commit history but
 we'll skipped that for now.

while the git checkout replaces all that changes that haved not been staged/commited
to the last commited version
